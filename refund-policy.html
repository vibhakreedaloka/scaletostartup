<p>We at www.scalestartup.in want you to be satisfied with your purchase of any of our products.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or problems, please let us know by contacting our support team directly. – support@scalestartup.in</p>
<p>If you couldn’t get the desired results with any of our products, contact our help group, show us you really took every necessary step by presenting ALL the work that you finished. We will survey it and endeavour to help right the issue. In the event that you have taken the necessary steps, and are not getting results, we will work with you one on one to enable you to accomplish results. In the event that we couldn’t help, we’ll issue a FULL refund.</p>
<p>To be eligible for a refund, you must submit your request and complete homework before 11:59pm Indian Standard Time on the 60th day following the end of the particular program. After you submit your materials, all refunds are discretionary*.</p>
<p>No refunds will be provided more than 60 days following the date of end of the particular program. There will be no exceptions.</p>
<p>If you opted for a payment plan, all payments must be completed. You may not cancel part way through. This is done to avoid fraud.</p>
<p>*Note: All refunds are discretionary. If you just downloaded the training material (pdfs, audios, videos, and/or etc), and then promptly asked for a refund, we reserve the right to deny your refund request.</p>
<p>The purpose of this policy is to allow individuals to attempt the framework, and on the off chance that it doesn’t work, they can recover the amount they invested. It wasn’t intended to allow individuals to take the preparation material and after that request a refund a couple of days later.</p>
<p>If you pay in full or choose the payment plan and take the course, implement the strategy, then there will be no refunds issued and you must complete the payment plan if you selected one.</p>
<p>If the payment plan is not completed on time, we will pursue it with a collection agency until the entire payment plan is made. Additional fees and fines might apply in this case.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if it is clear that your homework/ tasks are incomplete or that you did not implement the strategies taught in the course, your refund will be denied. However, we will still help and support you in order to get you results.</p>
<p>By purchasing, downloading or viewing any of our products you are also agreeing with our refund policy / terms and conditions.</p>
